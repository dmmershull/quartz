Qemp is the only city on the western cost of Yenu. 

Qemp is most well known for being a cultural center of enlightenment. The university is the best in the world for the study of non-magical affairs. 

As a reflection of this, the university also serves as the central government for the city and the home of the ruling house. 

Qemp is disliked by many other states for its like of devotion to wizadry and artificery as well as its housing of most Yuan-Ti who fled Zolaxis after the cataclysm. Many also suspect that the houses of Qemp harbor refugee sorcerers from other states, but do not have sufficient evidence on which to base this claim.
