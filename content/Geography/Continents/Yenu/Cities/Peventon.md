City of Nourishment

The northern most of the Yuvaulan cities, Peventon lies across the strait from [[Jurak]]. 

Peventon is separated from the rest of the Yuvaulan on the Island of Futhar. Most of the island is uninhabited as its primary use is agriculture and mining. 

On the far side of the island is [[Grove Town]], the only other formal goverment on the island. While Peventon does most of its trading with Jurack, Grovetown acts as the main port for resources going to and coming from Garthmouth.
