City of Mages
Home of The Inquisition

The city is governed by a council of 9, 8 mages and 1 non-mage representative who is the head of the inquisition. 

Up until recently only 7 mages sat on the council, but the college of necromancy has been reinstated in recent years. Most governments have objected to the reinstatement of the college, however the council holds that if the most powerful mages in Yenu are not willing to understand this ancient school of magecraft then it will be used to eventually destroy them. 

The Council:
 - NPC - Grand Inquisitor
 - NPC - Archon of Abjuration, Chief Architect
 - NPC - Archon of Transmutation, City planner?
 - NPC - Archon of Conjuration, Master of Commerce
 - NPC - Archon of Divination, Master Archivst
 - NPC - Archon of Enchantment, Chief Diplomat
 - NPC - Archon of Evocation, Admiral Arcane
 - NPC - Archon of Illusion, Master of Spies
 - NPC - Archon of Necromancy
