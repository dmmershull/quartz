Notes:

- Missing local: a local man want gathering in the woods and did not return over night
	- with a survival DC 15 the man can be found in a ravine with a broken leg. The ground gave out from under him and he fell far away from town or any of the normal gathering spots
- If any of the party ask about the shadow runner word will reach Ane within the hour. Ane will go as far as to follow the group out of town with her hunters to interrogate them about their interest in the shadow runner. 
	- She will go herself and take her two hands (2 archers)
		- Igrit and Rolof (Archers)
		- Sidsel (Berserker)

Rumors:
- Ghosts of old miners still haunt the abandoned mine
- A vengeful spirit lives in the forest and will take anyone found alone at night
- The shadow runner is actually a demon that was trapped in Zolaxis
