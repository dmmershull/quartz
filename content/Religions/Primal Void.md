The universe began in a state known as the primal void. This void was both endless and formless with two abstract entities of order and chaos. 

These two entities were deeply in love. However they were not able to be together as they were. In order to be together they would have to cast off their abstract forms and become the first material deities. 

It is unknown which entity became which deity, and some scholars argue that neither deity corresponds to any entity. Rather that the deities that resulted from this event are entirely new, birthed from the death of the primal entities along with the rest of the universe. 

These prime deities are:
 - Morso, The Paragon of death
 - Vitas, The Paragon of life
 - Tatio, The Paragon of change
