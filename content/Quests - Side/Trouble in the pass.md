After shortly arriving in [[Everpass]] adventurers can hear of recent troubles in the mountain pass. A guide recently returned to town bloodied in the middle of the night claiming that something or someone attacked him and his party while passing through the mountains. 

The adventurers may take this quest from any of the following:
 - [[Jenryn Starkpass]], Mountain Guide Director
 - [[Dolgrun Cangireg]], Mayor
Both Jenryn and Dolrun will request some evidence pertaining to the nature of the creature and assurance that the problem has been dealth with. 

If they do not run into either Jenryn or Dolgrun [[Brennyss Tetgek]], the inn keeper, will tell them about the issue and send them towards one of the two. 

The adventureres will gain favor and perks in everpass depending on who they complete the quest for. 
 - Jenryn: If they complete this quest for Jenryn they will receive favor with Jenryn and the mountain guides. Jenryn will pay the party 150 gold for their trouble. The party will also receive mountain guides at half-price in the future. 
 - Dolgrun: If they complete this quest for Dolgrun the party will receive favor with him. Additionally Dolgrun will pay the party 100 gold and cover up to a weeks stay at the inn whenever the party is in town. 


The quest: 

Once the adventureres accept this quest from either Jenryn or Dolgrun They can head up the mountain without a guide. 

They may attempt to get a guide form jenryn (DC 15 Persuasion). On a success jenryn will join them. On a failure Jenryn will refuse to go or send anyone with the party. 

Options: 
 - Search for the camp that was attacked
 - Search for the source of the attack
 - Camp for the night. 

Searching for the attacked camp:
The party may choose to search for the camp that was attacked. Doing so requires no survival or investigation check at the camp is on the trail, however getting to the camp does require half a days travel. 
Once at the camp any or all members of the party may make a survival or investigation.
- Survival (DC 14),  Investigation(DC 16)
	- A succesful survial check will identify scratch marks and blood from the camp into to a nearby cave off of the trail. Based on the damage to the camp it is hard to identify the exact creature, but it seems like it was many small creatures rather than 1 large creature. 

Search for the source
- If the adventuerers attempt to search for the source without finding the camp
- Survival Check (DC 18)

Camping for the night
- If the party camps for the night they will be attacked by 4 [[Young Kruthik| Young Kruthiks]]
- Once the encounter is complete use the rolls from search for the attacked camp to continue. 

The Cave
 - Inside the cave they will find the bodies of the travelers as well as several others. 
 - Inside the cave is a small Kruthik hive attempting to establish a new nest.
