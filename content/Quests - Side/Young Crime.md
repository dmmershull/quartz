## Robbery at the General Store
When the characters arrive in town, there is a small crowd gathered outside [Broheron's](Shops%20And%20Inns/Broheron's.md). Upon investigation, there has been a small robbery at the local general store. A local by the name of [Rathello "Rat" McDiggers](Rathello%20%22Rat%22%20McDiggers) broke in and assaulted one of the employees on his way out. The assaulted employee [Atlas](Player%20Characters/Atlas.md) currently sits on the front steps holding a cloth to his nose. [Broheron](Broheron) is speaking to the local guards, mostly chastising their lack of response to the incident. 

The local guards have been stripped thin recently. Law enforcement has been drafted into the Inquisitions efforts to patrol the countryside in search of [The Shadow Runner](The%20Shadow%20Runner). The officers tell Broheron that they will do the best they can do when they can, but that they barely have enough staff to patrol the town as it is. 

### Introducing [Atlas](Player%20Characters/Atlas.md)
After describing the interaction between [Broheron](Broheron) and the local police, give Atlas a chance to describe themselves with the caveat that they currently have a bloodied nose. 

### Pulling in the Others
All the others are standing in the crowd investigating the scene. After Atlas has had the chance to introduce themselves, open up the floor if any of the players would like to respond to the scene. 

## Tracking down Rat
If the players speak with the guards, they are happy to provide information about Rat. They promise no money in return for his arrest, but tell the party that it would be greatly appreciated and that they remember favors. They may direct the group toward the boys parents as a first lead. 

They can find Rat's father and mother at his house. They will tell the players about the group that Rat has been running around with on the outskirts of town.  

## Going to the bandit's hideout. 

The bandits have been holing up in an old dwarven mining camp a couple of miles outside of town. The mine attached to this settlement was abandoned decades ago when it did not have any more resources. Rat has run off here as part of his plan to lure the newcomer from town to the hideout to be robbed. The
