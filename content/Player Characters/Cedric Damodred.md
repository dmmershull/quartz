PC: Jon
Paladin

Was attacked by the #ShadowRunner while on an expedition with his patrol. He has been marked with an injury that will not heal. He told his superiors after he returned from the expedition that he was going to travel to Everpass to recruit. In Truth he is searching for the #ShadowRunner to learn more about them and their motives as well as possibly join their cause. 

Questions - 
 - Is there a group of sorceres that the inquisiiton would know about but aren't trying to go after due to their size and a desire to let them gorw in strength to raise the prestige of the higher ups? The shado runner is the most recent, I would say the Inquisition in the north is getting desperate because if the problem goes on for too long the higher ups will start sending in leadership from down south to take over and take care of the problem. 
 - Are there any dominant powers that protect sorcerers? Not officially, however there are rumors that the Lady Totzosa in Qemp houses sorcerers. None of that is founded but its mostly based off the face that her husband was executed for suspected sorcery and she used that to get the inquisition kicked out of Qemp. 
 - How do different casters who are permmitted to cast spells identify themselves? Usually some kind of uniform or identification. I think we discussed the enchated token that is distributed by the Acadium Arcanum. 
 - Was there a time when certain spells needed to be rediscovered after the cataclysm? Maybe some since Zolaxis was a big hub for magical research. None that I have written specifically.
 - Are there certain groups of people within the inquisition that can immidiately spot a sorcerer? Yes. There are individuals known as spell breakers that go through a rather intense process of learning anti-magic and having their senses enhanced to detect the presence of a sorcerer. However there are not many of them and since they are a rather new development and are reserved for high need situations. 
 - Is there a certain type of magic that is outlawed? Until recently Necromancy was outlawed, but necromantic research is now allowed by the archon and her assistants.
