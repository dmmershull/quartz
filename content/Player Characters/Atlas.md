PC: Sky
Warlock

Atlas is a Yuan-Ti who has unwittingly made a pact with the Eternal Citadel. The eternal citadel took Atlax from Zolaxis a couple of years before the cataclysm. The citadel's motives for doing this are unclear, but Atlas has the sensation that they are supposed to do something to help the sorcerous population of Yenu which has come under attack in the last century. 

Atlas has been dropped into everpass a couple of weeks before the beginning of the campaign. The residents of Everpass have done their best to help this strange Yuan-Ti who they think must have some case of amnesia.
