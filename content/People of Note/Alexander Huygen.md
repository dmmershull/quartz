This scientist has largely been shunned by the academic community in Garthmouth due to his outlandish theories. 

Originally, this scientist found renown in his study of wave mechanics. He wrote textbooks and lectured at the University of Gartmouth to young artificers in training. His main subjects were mathematics and elementary physics. 

He proposed an alternate theory of planar cosmology based around what he called fundametal frequencies. He proposed that our entire cosmos was nothing more than a higher-dimensional plane vibrating at certain frequencies. In his theory he says there are at least 2 of these fundamental frequencies, The frequency of moral and the frequency of order. When these two frequencies reached a certain super-position they gave birth to entire planes. 

As a consequence of this theory he argued that when one is born to a certain plane they are imbued to this frequency, and that in order to shift from one plane to another one must shift their embedded frequencies to align with their destination plane. 

He is still tenured at the university, but has not been published for some time. He is regarded by most as a very bright mathmetician, but a strange and eccentric man.
