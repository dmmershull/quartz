A human woman who until recently was imprisoned by the Acadium Arcanum for the study of Necromancy. 

Marie was an advanced student in the Acadium Arcanum. She was often found to be curious but disruptive. She would often argue with professors during lecture claiming that the accepted framework of practice was too restrictive and left out many possibilities. Marie started as a student of transmutation, fascinated with how magic could shape the world around her. She graduated from the Acadium Arcanum with honors, but dissapeared immediately after her graduation. 

Many of her peers speculated that she had sailed across the sea to practice in countries with a less restrictive view of magic, but the truth is she traveled across the great waste to practice in reclusion in the wilderness near Qemp. She had discovered old tomes of Necromancy and had been immediately enraptured by them. She found the texts to be nothing like what her professors had described Necromancy to be. The texts had an air of respect and reverence for the boundary that she had not expected. Her mastery of transmutation served her well as she shifted to the study of Necromancy.
