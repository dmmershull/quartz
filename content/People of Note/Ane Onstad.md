A couple of months back Ane was helped by Ozsi when the Inquisition attempted to take her months catch as well as her son as a suspected sorcerer. She was saved by Ozsi and in return promised to join his cause. He initiated her as a shadow runner and she has been acting as an informant/recruiter since. 

She has a small militia formed of members of the hunters lodge. Most towns folk suspect, but will not oust them. They, like most small villages, see the inquisition as a leech on this country.
