Information:
Member of [House Ssalkas](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Ssalkas.md)
Married into [House Totzosa](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Totzosa.md)

Ozsi was married to [Illie Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md) to strengthen the bond between their houses. While they did not know each other at first they came to love each other dearly and had five children together. 

Ozsi was executed in 1299 while on a diplomatic visit in [Gartmouth](Geography/Continents/Yenu/Cities/Gartmouth.md). He was accused and found guilty of being a sorcerer. When the leaders of [Gartmouth](Geography/Continents/Yenu/Cities/Gartmouth.md) brought this forward to the leaders of the other states they tried to take action against [Illie](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md) to force her and her children to never bear heirs, as it custom by law since [The Cataclysm](History/The%20Cataclysm.md). However, [Illie](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md) was able to prove that they did not have sufficient evidence that he was a sorcerer and therefore had no right to order an end to her family line. In exchange for this she promised the other houses that she would take no action against them for the murder of her husband. 

The truth of this is that Ozsi was a sorcerer and the fact that they did not have enough evidence was purely chance that [Illie](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md) was able to take advantage of. 

Ozsi's body was transported after the trial to the family crypt in Qemp.
