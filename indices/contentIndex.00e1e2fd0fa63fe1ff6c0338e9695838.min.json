He has been marked with an injury that will not heal. He told his superiors after he returned from the expedition that he was going to travel to Everpass to recruit. In Truth he is searching for the #ShadowRunner to learn more about them and their motives as well as possibly join their cause. \n\nQuestions - \n - Is there a group of sorceres that the inquisiiton would know about but aren't trying to go after due to their size and a desire to let them gorw in strength to raise the prestige of the higher ups? The shado runner is the most recent, I would say the Inquisition in the north is getting desperate because if the problem goes on for too long the higher ups will start sending in leadership from down south to take over and take care of the problem. \n - Are there any dominant powers that protect sorcerers? Not officially, however there are rumors that the Lady Totzosa in Qemp houses sorcerers. None of that is founded but its mostly based off the face that her husband was executed for suspected sorcery and she used that to get the inquisition kicked out of Qemp. \n - How do different casters who are permmitted to cast spells identify themselves? Usually some kind of uniform or identification. I think we discussed the enchated token that is distributed by the Acadium Arcanum. \n - Was there a time when certain spells needed to be rediscovered after the cataclysm? Maybe some since Zolaxis was a big hub for magical research. None that I have written specifically.\n - Are there certain groups of people within the inquisition that can immidiately spot a sorcerer? Yes. There are individuals known as spell breakers that go through a rather intense process of learning anti-magic and having their senses enhanced to detect the presence of a sorcerer. However there are not many of them and since they are a rather new development and are reserved for high need situations. \n - Is there a certain type of magic that is outlawed? Until recently Necromancy was outlawed, but necromantic research is now allowed by the archon and her assistants. \n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Player-Characters/Character-Name-Dimitri":{"title":"Character Name - Dimitri","content":"\nWill Probably play a sorcerer\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntags:\n- #player\n- #Yenu \n- #Totzosa ","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Player-Characters/Vifjari-Monterac":{"title":"Vifjari Monterac","content":"\nPC: Blaine\nCleric","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Jurak/House-Cerulean":{"title":"House Cerulean","content":"\nUp and coming house, has control over Cedric and is trying to become a more powerful house to over throw the big three. \n\n\n---\nTags\n- #Yenu \n- #Jurak\n- #CedricDamodred\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Jurak/House-Damodred":{"title":"House Damodred","content":"\n\n\n--- \nTags\n- #Yenu \n- #Jurak\n- #CedricDamodred\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Jurak/House-Gavarin":{"title":"House Gavarin","content":"\nWorships [Rocea](Religions/Gods/Rocea.md), Icon of the Sea\n\n\n---\nTags\n- #Yenu \n- #Jurak\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Jurak/House-Monterac":{"title":"House Monterac","content":"\nHome house of player [Vifjari Monterac](Player%20Characters/Vifjari%20Monterac.md).\n \n---  \nTags\n- #Yenu \n- #Jurak\n- #VifjariMonterac\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Jurak/House-Murrus":{"title":"House Murrus","content":"\nWorships [Ornax](Religions/Gods/Ornax.md), Icon of the forge\n\n\n---\nTags\n- #Yenu \n- #Jurak\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Qemp/House-Estohsa":{"title":"House Estohsa","content":"\nnoble house, leads Qemp's military efforts\n\nHouse Sigil:\n![House Sigil Estohsa](Attatchments/House%20Sigil%20Estohsa.jpg)\nHouse Motto: \"Strike Fast and True\"\n\nRuling Member:\n\nHouse members:\n\n\n\n---\ntags:\n - #Yenu \n - #Qemp\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Qemp/House-Mezsi":{"title":"House Mezsi","content":"\nnoble house, leads economic development\n\nHouse Sigil:\n![House Sigil Mezsi](Attatchments/House%20Sigil%20Mezsi.jpg)\n\nHouse Motto: \"Lighting the Way\"\n\nRuling Member:\n\nHouse Members:\n\n\n---\ntags:\n - #Yenu \n - #Qemp\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Qemp/House-Ssalkas":{"title":"House Ssalkas","content":"\nnoble house, Leads civil efforts (expansion and maintaining of the city)\n\nHouse Sigil:\n![House Sigil Ssalkas](Attatchments/House%20Sigil%20Ssalkas.jpg)\nHouse Motto: \"Strike one down, two more shall rise\"\n\nRuling Member:\n\nHouse members:\n\n---\ntags:\n - #Yenu \n - #Qemp\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Qemp/House-Totzosa":{"title":"House Totzosa","content":"\nNoble House, Head house of Qemp\n\nHouse Sigil: Ouroboros\n\n![Hose Sigil Totzosa](Attatchments/Hose%20Sigil%20Totzosa.jpg)\n\nHouse Motto: \"All that lives must die.\"\n\nRuling Member: [Illie Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md)\n\nHouse Members:\n - [Alkal Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Alkal%20Totzosa.md)\n - [Allie Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Allie%20Totzosa.md)\n - [Illie Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Illie%20Totzosa.md)\n - [Ohlizei Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Ohlizei%20Totzosa.md)\n - [Osolah Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Osolah%20Totzosa.md)\n - [Ozsi Totzosa](People%20of%20Note/Ozsi%20Totzosa.md)\n\n---\ntags:\n - #Yenu \n - #Qemp\n - #Totzosa\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/Houses/Qemp/Houses":{"title":"Houses","content":"\n - [House Totzosa](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Totzosa.md)\n - [House Ssalkas](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Ssalkas.md)\n - [House Estohsa](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Estohsa.md)\n - [House Mezsi](Politics/Houses/Qemp/House%20Mezsi.md)\n\n\n---\ntags:\n - #Yenu \n - #Qemp\n---","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Politics/The-Inquisition":{"title":"The Inquisition","content":"\nBased in [Huvarm](Geography/Continents/Yenu/Cities/Huvarm.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.795582259Z","tags":null},"/Quests-Side/Trouble-in-the-pass":{"title":"Trouble in the pass","content":"\nAfter shortly arriving in [Everpass](Geography/Continents/Yenu/Towns/Everpass.md) adventurers can hear of recent troubles in the mountain pass.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.799582353Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first.

This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-12-29T23:13:26.803582447Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
